What works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The webserver accepts both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 requests and responds accordingly.
Works for IPV6 also.
The server deals with the required css, js and html files, other are treated as text files.
Meminfo works and responds correctly
Loadavg works and responds correctly.
Runloop successfully runs and adjusts the load average.
Allocanon successful allocates memory.
Freeanon successful removes the last block given.
Supports multiple client by threading. 
Errors are caught so they won't shut down the server.

Design
==========================

Our webserver is a 10 socket server.
It uses mutexes to protect data during threading.
The server waits for a connection then it creates a thread and calls the echo function.
It is a robust implementation in that it will respond to both http 1.0 and http 1.1 
requests given the correct header as well as safely handling bad requests. 
It also handles binary files of mime type html, js, and css as described in the spec. 
Other mime types are treated as txt.
